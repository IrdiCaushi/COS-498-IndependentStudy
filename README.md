# COS-498-IndependentStudy

Ethereum Blockchain

I have developed a decentralized application that is 
used to count votes in a competition. I have named this 
as “COS Major Courses Competition”. In the application 
there is the list section where courses are listed with 
their votes, name, and number. There is also a drop-down 
list to choose which course you want to vote for and a 
button named “vote.push_back()” that submits the vote for
the chosen course.
